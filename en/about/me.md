I am ~~a software engineer at [Asiainfo Inc.](https://asiainfo.com)~~ currently open to [job opportunities](mailto:yevwang@qq.com), currently based in Chengdu, China. My primary skill set encompasses Vue, React, Svelte, Flutter, and TypeScript.

In addition to my [GitHub](https://github.com/wangyewei), you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yev_wang), where you can get in touch with me. If you happen to speak Chinese, my Chinese name is 王野未 (wǎng yě wèi). You can also communicate with me in Chinese.

Outside of programming, I enjoy coffee (dark roast-only), music, and watching films. Recently, I've been writing some [letters](#), even though they were never sent, and occasionally composing [poems](#).

[Anything to add?](#)
